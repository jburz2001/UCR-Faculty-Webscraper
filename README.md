# UCR-Faculty-Webscraper
This project serves to display information about different departments at the University of California, Riverside.
It is still a work in progress, but it helps the public visualize data and Justin Burzachiello improve his skills with web scraping and data visualization.

This code uses Selenium, NLTK, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas to extract data on UCR faculty.
To run this code, you must have the previously stated modules installed, and a Chrome Webdriver must be available on your device.
